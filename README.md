# JackTrip is a Linux, Mac OSX, or Windows multi-machine audio system used for network music performance over the Internet.
It supports any number of channels (as many as the computer/network can handle) of bidirectional, high quality, uncompressed audio signal streaming.

You can use it between any combination of machines e.g., one end using Linux can connect to another using Mac OSX.

# Other Repos

It then moved to the CCRMA's cm-gitlab for version 1.2.
And as of spring 2020 it moved back to GitHub for the current development.
